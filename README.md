# corpus: The Ultimate Python Mathematics Library

corpus is a comprehensive, all-in-one mathematics library with 450+ methods across 20 modules. It combines numerical computing, symbolic mathematics, and advanced algorithms into a single, cohesive package.

**Key Features:**
- **Complete Coverage**: Calculus, ODE/PDE solvers, optimization, special functions, tensor analysis, vector calculus, complex analysis, and probability theory
- **Multi-Paradigm**: Both numerical approximations and symbolic computations with SymPy integration
- **Industrial-Grade**: Leverages NumPy/SciPy when available, with pure Python fallbacks
- **User-Friendly**: Consistent API with extensive documentation and type hints

**Perfect for**: Scientists, engineers, educators, researchers, and students who need a unified math toolkit without juggling multiple libraries.

From basic arithmetic to tensor calculus—UltraMath has it all in one place!
